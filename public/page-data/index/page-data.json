These things usually don't quite belong in a design system. One example can be a `SaveButton` this will be an extension of the button with some differences that will be used in a lot of places.\n  If no design system is in place basically anything that's used by more than one page or component like an `Alert`.\n\n- `pages`- This is where your main pages will stay, this will have an `index.js` file that is where your route file be placed and where all these pages imported will be. Usually within a page you can have multiple sections like a hero, this won't be used anywhere else, but it's a crucial part and should have both an `index.js` and a styles file so we can put this in a folder as well to minimize the size of our files, while also making it easier to find things.\n\n- `assets` - This folder will contain all images and icons. I usually have both, so I find it easier to divide the folders since most of the times my icons will be in SVG and these will be translated into `JSX` and end up being also `JavaScript` files at their core.\n\n- `utils` - This is where your overly complicated functions go to. This is kind of like hiding the shame but in a calculated way. Let's say you need to transform dates in a component and its a pretty heavy function. In my opinion this should be its own file maybe generalized to dates so it can export several functions for date manipulation - trust me, there is always date manipulation.\n\n## File naming\n\nI always try to name my files `index.js` and let the folder name do the talking. This will allow me to have more freedom in the composition of that component or page, as more files may be added, and that way they all stay concise in that folder. So I may have something like:\n\n```\nsrc/components/Alert/index.js\n```\n\nEven though it's the index file, the way module resolution works in JavaScript you don't need to specify `index.js` so you can just import like you would a file:\n\n```js\nimport Alert from \"./components/Alert\";\n```\n\nThis will look for the file and then if it doesn't find for the folder and an `index` file in that folder so don't worry about more typing.\n\n## Exporting Components\n\nFor many years, I used the good old `export default` even though react always yelled at me, I would export a components like so:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nexport default ({ onClick }) => (\n  <>\n    <h1>Sup?</h1>\n    <button onClick={onClick}>I am a button</button>\n  </>\n);\n```\n\nOne of the drawbacks with this is how more INCREDIBLY hard it becomes to find anything in the devTools. For VSCode users, it also removes the autocomplete because you never named the component.\n\nIn the last years I have always exported the same component like so:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nconst ButtonWrapper = ({ onClick }) => (\n  <>\n    <h1>Sup?</h1>\n    <button onClick={onClick}>I am a button</button>\n  </>\n);\n\nexport default ButtonWrapper;\n```\n\nThis has two main advantages over default:\n\n- You can now see in the react devtools what the component name is making it for easier debugging and just overall cleaning of the devtools.\n- Autocomplete in VSCode, even without TypeScript, VSCode is pretty smart to do a run down of your folders and see the components name and see what is what you want. It's not bullet proof without TypeScript but honestly, it's pretty impressive and more than enough for me to be productive\n\n## TypeScript\n\nLet's talk about the elephant in the room _TypeScript_.\n\n#### Do you need it to build a react app?\n\nOh god no, even less in the start, I think TypeScript is one of those \"pluck it in when you need it\" type of tool. In the start it's definitely not needed, maybe your app will start feeling very prone to errors and it's a good idea but not in the start. Never in the start.\n\n#### Should I use it for my marketing page?\n\nHonestly...why? It will add way more complexity without improving gains a lot, you don't have state, you don't have complicated things, it's a website and not an app, so in all honesty there is no need for something as heavy as that.\n\n#### Fine, when do I need it?\n\nWhen honestly you can't manage state and you have no idea wtf is what anymore, and how many `isLoggedIn` states you have in your store, you need TypeScript when you would rather cry than manage state.\n\n#### What things should have Redux?\n\nIn my opinion, state and design systems are things where TypeScript is quite handy because these are things you use all the time and need to know what props you want to use, what they take and all of those fancy things.\n\n#### But what does a TypeScript react component look like?\n\nLets do one with state and props, let's take this simple components and make it all TypeScript compatible:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { AlertWrapper, Message, CloseButton } from \"./elements\";\n\nconst Alert = ({ onClose, type, children, neverClose }) => {\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState(true);\n\n  return open ? (\n    <AlertWrapper type={type}>\n      {!neverClose ? (\n        <CloseButton\n          onClick={e => {\n            setOpen(false);\n            onClose && onClose(e);\n          }}\n        >\n          x\n        </CloseButton>\n      ) : null}\n      <Message>{children}</Message>\n    </AlertWrapper>\n  ) : null;\n};\n```\n\nIn this case we have some props we may want to type, and looking at them we have:\n\n- `onClose` - An optional function that returns nothing and takes the event to the parent component.\n- `type` - The type of alert this is and in our case it can either be: `success`, `error` or `warning`.\n- `children` - Any react nodes we want to pass as the message\n- `neverClose` - An optional boolean attribute to check if want the user to be able to close it.\n\nSo let's transfer this into an interface in TypeScript:\n\n```ts\ninterface Props {\n  onClick?: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void;\n  type: \"success\" | \"error\" | \"warning\";\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  neverClose?: boolean;\n}\n```\n\nTo apply this to the react component we do as such:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { AlertWrapper, Message, CloseButton } from \"./elements\";\n\ninterface Props {\n  onClick?: (event: React.MouseEvent) => void;\n  type: \"success\" | \"error\" | \"warning\";\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  neverClose?: boolean;\n}\n\nconst Alert = ({ onClose, type, children, neverClose }: Props) => {\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState(true);\n\n  return open ? (\n    <AlertWrapper type={type}>\n      {!neverClose ? (\n        <CloseButton\n          onClick={e => {\n            setOpen(false);\n            onClose && onClose(e);\n          }}\n        >\n          x\n        </CloseButton>\n      ) : null}\n      <Message>{children}</Message>\n    </AlertWrapper>\n  ) : null;\n};\n```\n\nThere are many other types, but in general typing react components like these is not a though thing to do, but sometimes doing this will lead to more work like transpiling or debugging edge cases that is not always worth it.\n\nI have very strong opinions on TypeScript as I think it creates a barrier for people to get into web development in a way as open and accessible as I did, and most of the times for no reason. I would say 50% or more of apps don't need TypeScript at all, more than 80% don't need TypeScript all over their pages and 100% don't need TypeScript in a marketing page with no state management.\n\nIf you want your designer to make changes, add JSX, fix CSS and overall do some code, please avoid using TypeScript and it's not something that they need to learn and consider if you yourself need it when making an open source project or if it's creating a barrier of entrance for people who want to help.\n\n# Project Starters\n\nOne of the main issues that existed when React started was that it was incredibly hard to get started, you had to mess with webpack and do a lot of really hard things just to get an hello world up and running.\nIn the last couple of years that has gotten better we now have a lot of tools to help us get started writing React projects in no time but on the other hand we have so many and so good that sometimes its harder to know what starter to use.\nI will go through the three most used starters used right now to create different type of projects in react.\n\n## Create React App\n\n**Link: [https://create-react-app.dev/](https://create-react-app.dev/)**\n\nCreate React App is the first and most famous one, its made and maintained by the React team themselves so you know all the choices are have the team stamp of approval.\n\nWithout a doubt CRA (create react app short name) is the fastest way to get started and have some react code show up on your page but the main issue is that CRA is not very extensible as you don't have access to the webpack or even babel config so its a tradeoff you must know from the start as sometimes the only way to add something is to `eject` and that will leave you with _ALL_ the webpack config and no way to update your react scripts.\n\nLet's look at the pros and cons:\n\nProps:\n\n- Quick to get started\n- Supports most CSS preprocessors\n- Supports PWA\n- Easily updatable with new features\n- Support for SVG as React Components\n\nCons:\n\n- Not a lot of flexibility when it comes to changing the way it handles file types\n- No Server Side render Support\n- No decisions from the react team in terms of app building so all the router, state management etc will be up to you.\n\nIn my opinion create react app is a good starting point but if your application grows big enough it will also get out of hand and you will end up with a lot of webpack to handle either way.\n\n## Next\n\n**Link: [https://nextjs.org/](https://nextjs.org/)**\n\nNext is great, it comes prepared for a lot of things in your application, more than a starting point it's a guide to making server side rendered applications in react as that is supported out of the box and one of the biggest selling points of next.\n\nIt also makes some decisions for you like routing and styling but gives you the room to make your own and even extend their scripts by changing the babel configuration to support more things you may need.\n\nLet's say you don't want to use their styled options but prefer to use styled components, in that case you can extend the babel config by adding the plugin like in a new `.babelrc` file\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"next/babel\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\"babel-plugin-styled-components\"]\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to leave the `next/babel` plugin as that adds a lot of functionality and a lot of babel presets and plugins you can read more about it [here](https://nextjs.org/docs#customizing-babel-config).\n\nA big advantage of next is also that it has a simple way to get started with the cli, to make a new project you can simply run:\n\n```\nnpx create-next-app\n```\n\nSo let's look at the pros and cons of next in my opinion:\n\nPros:\n\n- Server side render support\n- Amazing docs with lessons to follow\n- Production grade\n- Customizing options\n\nCons:\n\n- Steep learning curve, mostly for being SSR things are just harder.\n-\n- **ZEIT PROPAGANDA ASK IVES ABOUT ZEIT NEXT THING**\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}}
